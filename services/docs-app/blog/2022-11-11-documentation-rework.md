Main purpose of the switching to docusaurus is well structured documentation web-app, but I would like to make a use out of the blog too.

But it will be necessary to somewhat define a process for adding new posts without clashing with other changes.

At the moment even `main` branch will work, but I think I prefer `develop`, and later move into separate repo?

Although it might makes sense to keep blog posts in the `develop` and publish them only to non-prod environments, while in prod you probably should skip `docs-app` completely.
