### Ingredient Replacement

It is virtually impossible to allow ***ingredient replacement*** in the ***recipe*** that is used as an ingredient on another page.

:::tip
In this case I would suggest users to copy that recipe into ***their recipe book***, and replace ***ingredient products*** to your liking and then use this "cloned" ***recipe as an ingredient***.
