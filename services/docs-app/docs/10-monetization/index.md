# Monetization



## Through Gamification

Might make sense to lock certain functionality behind "game currency" that you can get by completing certain tasks like:
- Referrals
- Creating foods or recipes that other people like & use
- Sharing recipes outside of RBA
- ...

Actions above will give users **point** which can be used for "recipe-scrapper" or any other tool or functionality, but since we're talking about monetization people will be able to just buy those **points**.

So there will be 2 ways to get full functionality: either you will make RBA alive or just pay.

## Sponsors & "Ads"

There won't be any ad banners or something similar, but it makes sense to research opportunities where some company's account can manage their own food and keep them up to date.
