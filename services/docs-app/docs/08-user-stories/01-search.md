# Search

This functionality spans across a couple of pages.

:::note
I think it makes sense to have single interface that allows all actions described below
:::

## *Find a recipe by name*

connects to: *[recipe-card](./recipe-card)*

1. Open home page of the application

1. Enter name of the recipe in the search bar

1. Select the result that fits

:::caution
You need to accommodate for dozens or even hundreds of options that might have the same name (separate page?).
:::

:::caution
You need to take into account simple foods: either filter them out by default, with ability toggle it back, or vice versa.
