# Units



- All amounts stored in database will use metric values, or more specifically grams (`g`) or grams per milliliter (`g/ml`) for density.

- Unit information which is attached to food/recipe in the database allows us to have "default units suggested by the author". ***It is not related to the amount values in the database!***

- !!! Behavior of user-specific unit setting needs to be defined
