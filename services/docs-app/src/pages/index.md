# Recipe Book App

Basically I started with a problem:

I would like to track how much and what I eat, to understand and control amount of consumed calories. 

But all solutions that are created for "fitness audience" are shit for collection and management of the recipes, and vice-versa where recipe sites are basically static pages.

So I remembered ***recipe book*** that my grandma had, and want to toy around with that idea, and with ***food journal*** you have "two books" that have links between each other.

From this whole situation you can instinctively also see a perfect way to add ***gamification***, because crafting/collection/achievements/etc are things that are very obvious here.

With all this being said, one of the other goals of this application is to help you find your love for cooking.
